# challenge-qr-code-component
This is a challenge I completed from Frontend Mentor, a QR code component that redirects you to Frontend Mentor website.

You can use this code to redirect a visitor to your own website or your client's website, customize it with the href you want and add your own QR code.

Check the code running in the following link: https://mauricio-perdomo-github.github.io/challenge-qr-code-component/
